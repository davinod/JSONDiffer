Open Items (Issues/Enhancements):

- Eventually the status of the JSON left and right are not being updated - Proposed
- Needs to change the content type of the /diff output to JSON instead of Plain-Text - Proposed
- The implementation to check the offsets may need some more review and refactoring - Proposed
- May need to discuss the requirements regarding having sessions to allow multiple users to use the app simultaneously
  the way it is designed, in a shared environment where multiple users will access the app, the json left and right
  may be replaced by other users - Proposed
